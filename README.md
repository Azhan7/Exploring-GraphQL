# Project Idea

Recently, during my reading sessions, I've came across GraphQL. I found the idea exciting and wanted to give it a try by implementing a basic project using GraphQL.

## What is GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for APIs. Basically, it gives clients the power to ask exactly what they want. To understand it further, consider your backend APIs are consumed by two front-end interfaces, be it Desktop and Mobile. And for some reason, both interfaces require separate fields. Without GraphQL, either you need to implement two types of APIs, one for your Desktop client and one for your Mobile Client, or you need to send the exact same data which you are sending to Desktop to your Mobile interface as well. But the problem is you are sending quite many fields to your mobile which is not being used by your mobile. To solve this issue GraphQL comes into play.

So, in a nutshell, when one has multiple interfaces which require multiple sets of field, GraphQL is your go to tool.

### Advantages:
1. Faster API performance.
2. Less Network Bandwith.
